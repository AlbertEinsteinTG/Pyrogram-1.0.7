        """Send video files.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            video (``str``):
                Video to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send a video that exists on the Telegram servers,
                pass an HTTP URL as a string for Telegram to get a video from the Internet, or
                pass a file path as string to upload a new video that exists on your local machine.

            file_ref (``str``, *optional*):
                A valid file reference obtained by a recently fetched media message.
                To be used in combination with a file id in case a file reference is needed.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                Video caption, 0-1024 characters.

            parse_mode (``str``, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.
                Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only.
                Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only.
                Pass None to completely disable style parsing.

            duration (``int``, *optional*):
                Duration of sent video in seconds.

            width (``int``, *optional*):
                Video width.

            height (``int``, *optional*):
                Video height.

            thumb (``str``, *optional*):
                Thumbnail of the video sent.
                The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size.
                A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320 pixels.
                Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file.

            supports_streaming (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True, if the uploaded video is suitable for streaming.
                Defaults to True.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            reply_to_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.

            schedule_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Date when the message will be automatically sent. Unix time.

            reply_markup (:obj:`InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

            progress (``callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the *progress_args* parameter.
                You can either keep *\*args* or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            :obj:`Message` | ``None``: On success, the sent video message is returned, otherwise, in case the upload
            is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Send video by uploading from local file
                app.send_video("me", "video.mp4")

                app.send_video("me", "video.mp4", caption="recording")

                # Keep track of the progress while uploading
                def progress(current, total):
                    print("{:.1f}%".format(current * 100 / total))
