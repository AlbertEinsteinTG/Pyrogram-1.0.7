        """Stop a poll which was sent by you.

        Stopped polls can't be reopened and nobody will be able to vote in it anymore.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_id (``int``):
                Identifier of the original message with the poll.

            reply_markup (:obj:`InlineKeyboardMarkup`, *optional*):
                An InlineKeyboardMarkup object.

        Returns:
            :obj:`Poll`: On success, the stopped poll with the final results is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                app.stop_poll(chat_id, message_id)
