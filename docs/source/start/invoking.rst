Calling Methods
===============

At this point, we have successfully :doc:`installed Pyrogram <../intro/install>` and :doc:`authorized <auth>` our
account; we are now aiming towards the core of the library. It's time to start playing with the API!

Basic Usage
-----------

Making API method calls with Pyrogram is very simple. Here's an example we are going to examine:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client

    app = Client("my_account")

    app.start()

    print(app.get_me())
    app.send_message("me", "Hi, it's me!")
    app.send_location("me", 51.500729, -0.124583)
    app.send_sticker("me", "CAADBAADyg4AAvLQYAEYD4F7vcZ43AI")

    app.stop()

#.  Let's begin by importing the Client class from the Pyrogram package:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pyrogram import Client

#.  Now instantiate a new Client object, "my_account" is a session name of your choice:

    .. code-block:: python

        app = Client("my_account")

#.  To actually make use of any method, the client has to be started first:

    .. code-block:: python

        app.start()

#.  Now, you can call any method you like:

    .. code-block:: python

        print(app.get_me())  # Print information about yourself

        # Send messages to yourself:
        app.send_message("me", "Hi!")  # Text message
        app.send_location("me", 51.500729, -0.124583)  # Location
        app.send_sticker("me", "CAADBAADyg4AAvLQYAEYD4F7vcZ43AI")  # Sticker

#.  Finally, when done, simply stop the client:

    .. code-block:: python

        app.stop()

Context Manager
---------------

You can also use Pyrogram's Client in a context manager with the ``with`` statement. The client will automatically
:meth:`~pyrogram.Client.start` and :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop` gracefully, even in case of unhandled exceptions in
your code. The example above can be therefore rewritten in a much nicer way:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrogram import Client

    app = Client("my_account")

    with app:
        print(app.get_me())
        app.send_message("me", "Hi there! I'm using **Pyrogram**")
        app.send_location("me", 51.500729, -0.124583)
        app.send_sticker("me", "CAADBAADyg4AAvLQYAEYD4F7vcZ43AI")
